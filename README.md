# NBA Trivia
This project is a trivia web app that tests your knowledge of the 
National Basketball Association's history and facts about its players, franchises, etc. The reason why I decided to make this is because I am a fan of basketball, and one of my favourite youtubers, KOT4Q, has many videos on him completing NBA quizzes. So, I figured it would be great to make my own version. The project uses the vue.js
framework for javascript as well as bootstrap-vue for css!
