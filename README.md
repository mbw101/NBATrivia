# NBA Trivia

> This project is a Vuejs trivia web app that tests your knowledge of the 
National Basketball Association's history and facts about its players, franchises, etc. The reason why I decided to make this is because I am a fan of basketball, and one of my favourite youtubers, KOT4Q, has many videos on him completing NBA quizzes. So, I figured it would be great to make my own version. The project uses the vue.js framework for javascript as well as bootstrap-vue for css! Also, Node.js is used for the backend
to read the JSON file.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## TODO:
* Try to add a separate credit that may have different text on the quiz start screen
* Phone queries need to be updated slightly with the title been below the button on some phones
